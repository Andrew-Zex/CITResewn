# CIT Item
<h6>Note that features marked in <em>italics</em> are unique to CIT Resewn.</h6>

This page applies to CITs marked with `type=item`(optional as `item` is the default type).

CIT Item replaces the appearance of:

 - Items in inventories
 - Items in the hotbar
 - Held Items
 - Items worn in the head slot
 - Items in item frames
 - Dropped items
 - Tossed projectiles(snowball, egg, enderpearl, splash/lingering potions, etc..)

The replacement can either be a `json` model or a `png` texture.

## Conditions

### Target
The CIT must match the item that has its appearance changed.

### Overrides
The `items` condition is required for this type. [**(the CIT can be named after an item in the namespace to add this automatically)**]{For example: &#10 diamond_hoe.properties}


## Effects

| Key                         | Value Type        | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**`texture`**]{Aliases: &#10 tile|right} | [**[Texture Asset](/cit/cit_base/#asset-resolution) <br> (`.png`)**]{Examples: &#10 texture=./my_textures/stick_texture.png &#10 texture=assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit/item_textures/texture &#10 texture=minecraft:item/texture.png|right} | Replaces the item's model with one generated by the resolved texture. [**The parent of the generated model is the model associated with the first item in `items`.**]{This is what allows sword texture replacements to inherit the 'handheld' type of model for example.} | None |
| `model` | [**[Model Asset](/cit/cit_base/#asset-resolution) <br> (`.json`)**]{Examples: &#10 model=./my_models/stick_model.json &#10 model=assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit/item_models/model &#10 model=minecraft:item/model.json|right} | Replaces the item's model with one described by the resolved json. [This uses the vanilla model formatting](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Models). <br> Models loaded by this property also gain the ability to load relative assets for textures, parents and overrides by prefixing `./`. <br> When `texture` is also declared, the texture is used to replace all of the textures in the model loaded by the json. | None |
| `texture.`[**<ins>  sub  </ins>**]{Examples: &#10 texture.bow_pulling_2 &#10 texture.crossbow_firework &#10 texture.potion_overlay|right} | [**[Texture Asset](/cit/cit_base/#asset-resolution) <br> (`.png`)**]{Examples: &#10 texture.bow_pulling_2=my_bow_pulling_2.png &#10 texture.crossbow_firework=my_crossbow_with_a_firework.png &#10 texture.potion_overlay=cool_potion_liquid.png|right} | Same as `texture` but replaces a sub texture instead. Multiple sub textures may be defined. This can be used for both model overrides and layer textures. <br> For overrides, the sub texture name is the sub model file's name (e.g.`bow_pulling_2` for a fully pulled bow). <br> For layers, the sub texture name is either the layer name (e.g.`layer1`) or the texture file name (e.g.`potion_overlay`). | None |
| `model.`[**<ins>  sub  </ins>**]{Examples: &#10 model.bow_pulling_2 &#10 model.crossbow_firework &#10 model.light_13|right} | [**[Model Asset](/cit/cit_base/#asset-resolution) <br> (`.json`)**]{Examples: &#10 model.bow_pulling_2=my_bow_pulling_2.json &#10 model.crossbow_firework=my_crossbow_with_a_firework.json &#10 model.light_13=cool_light_model_13.json|right} | Same as `model` but replaces a sub model instead. Multiple sub models may be defined. This can be used for model overrides. <br> The sub model name is the sub model file's name (e.g.`bow_pulling_2` for a fully pulled bow). | None |
